    <h2 i18n>Welcome!</h2>

    <p i18n>Footero is the new way of planning matches between friends and colleagues. Let's explore some interesting features already available:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong i18n>Carpooling</strong>. <span i18n>With Footero, you can share your car with other players to join a place or ask for a seat in someone else's car to go and play your favourite sport. Let's improve transportation together!</span></li>
        <li><strong i18n>Notifications</strong>. <span i18n>Being notified of changes is important when planning events. Should I keep or should I cancel this match? May I find everyone there? Did anybody cancel or change of mind? Footeroo will let you know about it.</span></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p i18n>Start using Footeroo by clicking on one of the options below.</p>
